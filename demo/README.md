# SSTS Demonstration Scripts (Optional)

## Purpose of this Folder

This folder contains **demonstration-only scripts and visualizations** for  
**Shunyaya Structural Transition Science (SSTS)**.

These artifacts exist solely to make SSTS **intuitive and interpretable**.

They are provided **only for visualization and explanation** and do **not**
introduce new results.

**These scripts do NOT constitute evidence and are NOT used in any SSTS phase results.**

---

## What These Demos Do

These demonstrations:

- **Visualize deterministic SSTS gate partitions**
- **Illustrate history-dependent admissibility posture**
- **Help readers understand `DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW` behavior**
- **Show why `Energy_legal != Transition_admissible` in practice**

All plots and CSVs visualize **deterministic outputs already proven**
by the main SSTS scripts and documents.

---

## What These Demos Do NOT Do

These demonstrations explicitly do **not** perform:

- No learning
- No fitting
- No simulation
- No optimization
- No semantic inference
- No chemistry or physics modeling
- No prediction, yield estimation, or rate analysis

They do not alter thresholds, parameters, or admissibility logic.

---

## Important Clarification

These demonstrations **do not define SSTS behavior**.

All authoritative definitions, thresholds, guarantees, and proofs are defined
**exclusively** in the main SSTS phases and scripts.

The `demo/` folder is **illustrative only** and must **not** be used as a
substitute for evidentiary results.
