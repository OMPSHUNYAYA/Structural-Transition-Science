## SECTION A — Purpose & Positioning

### A1. What is Shunyaya Structural Transition Science, in simple terms?

SSTS is a **deterministic science** that decides when a system is **structurally permitted** to transition between domains.

Most critically, it governs the boundary:

**physics → chemistry**

SSTS answers a question classical science does not formalize:

> “Is this transition permitted to occur at all?”

SSTS does not predict.  
SSTS does not optimize.  
SSTS evaluates **permission**.

---

### A2. Why is SSTS needed between physics and chemistry?

Because classical science often assumes:

- if energy is sufficient, transition may occur  
- legality implies admissibility  
- failure is explained after the fact  

In reality:

- excitation often does not commit  
- pressure does not always transform  
- heat does not guarantee chemistry  

SSTS formalizes the **missing layer** between energy legality and chemical commitment.

---

### A3. Does SSTS replace physics, chemistry, or kinetics?

No.

- Physics remains correct.  
- Chemistry remains correct.  
- Kinetics remains correct.  

SSTS operates **before** them by answering:

> “Is transition structurally permitted to begin?”

---

### A4. Is SSTS theoretical or speculative?

No.

SSTS is fully deterministic and validated through:

- executable phase tests  
- monotonicity proofs  
- external negative controls  
- history-dependent evidence  
- cross-domain invariance  
- canonical transition case studies  

All claims are backed by **reproducible runs**.

---

## SECTION B — How SSTS Works

### B1. What exactly does SSTS evaluate?

SSTS evaluates **structural admissibility**, not outcomes.

It determines whether structural conditions permit reorganization **before chemistry commits**.

---

### B2. What does “admissibility” mean in SSTS?

Admissibility means:

> “The system is structurally permitted to reorganize.”

It is **not** about magnitude.  
It is **not** about rate.  
It is **not** about mechanism.  

It is about **permission**.

---

### B3. Why does SSTS not modify equations or outcomes?

Because modifying science destroys meaning.

SSTS enforces a strict boundary:

- equations remain untouched  
- laws remain intact  
- only permission is evaluated  

SSTS collapses cleanly back to classical science.

---

### B4. What is DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW?

These are **admissibility postures**:

- **DENY** — transition is structurally forbidden  
- **ABSTAIN** — evidence is insufficient to permit commitment  
- **ALLOW** — transition is structurally permitted  

**ABSTAIN is intentional and critical.**

It prevents fabricated certainty.  
ABSTAIN is the **default posture near structural boundaries** and must not be interpreted as indecision or uncertainty.

---

## SECTION C — Permission, Not Execution

### C1. How is SSTS different from simulation or prediction?

SSTS does not simulate trajectories.  
SSTS does not predict outcomes.

It evaluates whether transition should be attempted **at all**.

---

### C2. Can energy be sufficient but transition still denied?

Yes.

This is the core axiom of SSTS:

`Energy_legal != Transition_admissible`

Energy may exist.  
Permission may not.

---

### C3. Does SSTS ever force or block a reaction?

No.

SSTS does not act.  
It does not enforce.  
It does not intervene.

It evaluates admissibility — then steps aside.

---

## SECTION D — The Structural Gate

### D1. What is the SSTS admissibility gate?

The gate evaluates bounded structural coordinates:

`S = (g, a, c)`

Admissibility:

`A_s = H( f(g,a,c) - tau )`

This is a **gate**, not a model.

---

### D2. Why is monotonicity important?

Monotonicity guarantees:

- stronger structure cannot reduce admissibility  
- behavior is stable under refinement  
- the gate is not fragile or arbitrary  

All SSTS phases explicitly test this.

---

### D3. Does the gate depend on domain semantics?

No.

SSTS operates on **structural coordinates only**.

Semantics remain the responsibility of domain science.

---

## SECTION E — Deterministic Validation

### E1. Why are multi-phase executable tests included?

To remove ambiguity.

Every claim in SSTS is:

- executed  
- reproducible  
- deterministic  

No claim relies on interpretation alone.

---

### E2. What do Phases 1–3 establish?

They establish that the gate:

- partitions DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW  
- behaves monotonically  
- is robust under parameter variation  

This proves SSTS is a **lawful permission system**.

---

### E3. Why is external negative control evidence critical?

Because permissive systems fail silently.

Phase 4A proves SSTS correctly refuses transitions when:

- structure is absent  
- context is removed  
- coherence is violated  

Refusal is as important as allowance.

---

## SECTION F — History, Universality & Canonical Evidence

### F1. Why does SSTS include resistance and history (Phase 5)?

Because transitions **remember stress**.

Identical endpoints can carry different admissibility posture due to accumulated resistance `s`.

This proves SSTS is **path-sensitive**, not state-only.

---

### F2. What does cross-domain invariance mean (Phase 6)?

It means the **same gate applies across domains**.

Physics, chemistry, and materials share:

- the same admissibility logic  
- the same monotonic behavior  
- no domain-specific rewrites  

SSTS is a **general transition grammar**.

---

### F3. What are canonical transition cases (Phase 7)?

Phase 7 provides named, human-legible transition cases demonstrating:

- energy may be available but transition is denied  
- context or access may permit transition  
- identical endpoints can differ in admissibility  

These cases exist to make the abstract gate interpretable — **without simulation or domain modeling**.

---

### F4. Does SSTS require domain-specific tuning?

No.

Adapters map domains into `(g,a,c)`.  
The gate remains unchanged.

---

## SECTION G — Usage, Safety & Scope

### G1. Is SSTS safe for production or critical systems?

No.

SSTS is intended for:

- research  
- diagnostics  
- structural analysis  
- safety reasoning  
- explainability  

---

### G2. Why are learning and heuristics excluded?

Because permission must be:

- explicit  
- auditable  
- reproducible  

Learning obscures causality.  
Heuristics hide boundaries.

---

### G3. What kinds of use are appropriate?

Appropriate use includes:

- scientific boundary analysis  
- reaction admissibility study  
- transition safety reasoning  
- foundational research  

---

## SECTION H — The Bigger Picture

### H1. Is SSTS standalone or part of a larger framework?

Both.

SSTS stands alone as a transition science  
and integrates naturally with **SSAE, SSB, and SSE**.

---

### H2. Why is SSTS considered a new science layer?

Because it formalizes a question never given a law:

> “When is transition permitted to occur?”

---

### H3. What is the long-term significance?

SSTS enables:

- permission-aware science  
- safer automation  
- conservative decision boundaries  
- explicit transition governance  

---
