## 🔎 What Is Shunyaya Structural Transition Science?

Shunyaya Structural Transition Science (SSTS) is a **deterministic framework**
that evaluates whether a system is **structurally permitted** to transition
between domains — most critically, from **physics to chemistry**.

Classical science typically asks:

**Physics asks:**  
Is energy present and conserved?

**Chemistry asks:**  
What reactions occur and at what rates?

**SSTS asks a prior question:**  
Is transition permitted to occur at all?

SSTS:

- does **not** replace physics  
- does **not** replace chemistry  
- does **not** predict outcomes or rates  

It evaluates **permission**, then collapses cleanly back to classical science.

## ⚡ One-Minute Structural Claim (Read This First)

Energy legality does **not** imply transition admissibility.

SSTS introduces a **deterministic permission layer** that decides whether a
transition is allowed to begin — before execution, simulation, or chemical
commitment.

- Physics remains correct  
- Chemistry remains correct  
- SSTS adds what was missing: **explicit transition permission**

Admissibility is evaluated conservatively and reproducibly using:

**DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW**

## 🎯 Problem Statement — Why Energy Is Not Enough

Classical science often assumes:

- sufficient energy implies possible transition  
- legality implies admissibility  
- failure is explained after commitment  

In real systems:

- excitation often does not commit  
- pressure does not always transform  
- identical energies yield different outcomes  
- chemistry sometimes **must not occur**

Energy legality is **not** transition admissibility.

Classical science has no formal layer that decides when energy may safely
become chemistry.

**SSTS fills this missing layer.**

---

## 🧱 The Structural Transition Gate

SSTS introduces a **minimal, non-invasive admissibility gate**.

**Structural coordinates:**

`S = (g, a, c)`

Where:

- `g` = geometric alignment  
- `a` = internal mode accessibility  
- `c` = configurational constraint  

**Admissibility gate:**

`A_s = H( f(g,a,c) - tau )`

This is a **gate**, not a model.

- no probability  
- no kinetics  
- no simulation  
- no optimization  

All domain laws remain unchanged.

---

### 🧩 Adapter Note (Reproducibility)

The structural state `S = (g, a, c)` used by SSTS is **not abstract**.

For chemistry-domain inputs (RSMI-encoded reactions), a **minimum, fully deterministic,
semantics-free adapter** defining exactly how to compute `(g, a, c)` is provided in:

`docs/ADAPTER_MIN_SPECS_CHEM_RSMI_MIN_v1.md`

This adapter:

- uses only standard string operations
- introduces no chemical inference or domain semantics
- is sufficient to reproduce all published SSTS chemistry results
- serves as the **normative reference** for `(g, a, c)` computation in this domain

Additional domain adapters may exist in the future, but **never replace**
this minimum reference.

---

## 🔍 What SSTS Evaluates

SSTS evaluates **structural permission**, not outcomes.

It operates **before**:

- bond rearrangement  
- chemical commitment  
- irreversibility  

SSTS distinguishes cases classical science cannot separate:

- same energy, different commitment  
- excitation that must not proceed  
- transitions that are physically legal but structurally forbidden  

SSTS answers whether transition is permitted — then steps aside.

---

## 🧭 DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW

SSTS partitions admissibility into three explicit postures:

- **DENY** — transition is structurally forbidden  
- **ABSTAIN** — evidence is insufficient to permit commitment  
- **ALLOW** — transition is structurally permitted  

**ABSTAIN is intentional.**  
It prevents false certainty near structural boundaries.

---

## 🧠 History-Dependent Transition Posture (Phase 5)

SSTS is **path-sensitive**, not state-only.

Through accumulated resistance `s`, SSTS shows that:

- identical endpoints can carry different admissibility posture  
- prior denied or near-threshold attempts matter  
- recovery is possible, but never assumed  

This establishes SSTS as a **history-aware transition science**.

---

## 🌐 Cross-Domain Invariance (Phase 6)

SSTS is not chemistry-specific.

The same admissibility gate applies across domains via deterministic adapters:

- physics phase transitions  
- chemical reaction commitment  
- material yield and fracture  

All domains exhibit:

- stable `DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW` partitions  
- monotonic behavior under stronger drivers  
- no domain-specific rewrites  

SSTS is a **general transition grammar**.

---

## 🧩 Canonical Structural Transition Cases (Phase 7)

Phase 7 introduces named, human-legible canonical cases demonstrating that:

- energy may be present while transition remains forbidden  
- context, access, or coherence may enable permission  
- identical endpoints can differ in admissibility posture  

Canonical cases include:

- symmetry barriers  
- nucleation / seed dependence  
- access enablement  
- excitation without coordination  
- pathway-dependent transitions  

These cases are encoded purely structurally using `(g,a,c)`:

- no simulation  
- no kinetics  
- no semantic interpretation  

Phase 7 strengthens interpretability while preserving rigor.

---

## 🧪 Determinism & Reproducibility

Given identical inputs, SSTS guarantees:

- identical admissibility outcomes  
- identical resistance accumulation  
- identical monotonicity behavior  

No randomness.  
No learning.  
No heuristics.  
No hidden state.

All phase tests are executable, append-only, and reproducible.

---

## 🎨 Optional Demonstration & Visualization (Non-Evidentiary)

This repository includes an optional `demo/` directory containing
visualization-only scripts and plots.

These demos:

- visualize already-proven admissibility behavior  
- help interpret `DENY / ABSTAIN / ALLOW` partitions  
- illustrate history-dependent posture graphically  

**Important:**  
Demo scripts and plots are **not evidence**, not phase results, and not used
in any proofs.

They:

- do not train  
- do not fit  
- do not simulate  
- do not affect outputs  

They exist solely for interpretability and communication.

---

## 🚫 What SSTS Is Not

SSTS is not:

- a reaction model  
- a rate law  
- a simulator  
- a predictor  
- an optimizer  
- a decision engine  

SSTS does not force transitions.  
SSTS does not block execution.

It evaluates **permission only**.

---

## 🔍 Interpretation Boundaries

SSTS is **observation-only**.

- admissibility is structural, not semantic  
- no real-world safety guarantees are implied  
- not intended for autonomous or critical control  

SSTS provides **permission visibility**, not enforcement.

## 🧭 Positioning Within the Shunyaya Framework

SSTS is part of a layered family of conservative, collapse-safe sciences,
each with a single, non-overlapping responsibility:

- **SSOM** — structural admissibility at mathematical origin  
- **SSM** — symbolic posture and instantaneous alignment  
- **SSUM** — structural evolution and accumulation over time  
- **SSD** — diagnostic visibility into structural erosion and drift  
- **SSTS** — permission for transitions between domains  
- **SSE** — governance of reliance and trust admissibility  

Each layer preserves exact classical correctness.

No layer replaces physics, chemistry, or mathematics.

Only **structural visibility and responsibility** are added —  
never intervention, prediction, or enforcement.
