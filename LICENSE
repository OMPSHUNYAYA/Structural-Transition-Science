Research and Usage Notice

Shunyaya Structural Transition Science (SSTS) is a deterministic, structure-based transition framework that governs admissibility of transitions between domains (e.g., physics to chemistry) without modifying underlying physical or chemical laws.

SSTS is provided for:

foundational and interdisciplinary research
structural transition analysis
admissibility and boundary studies
explainability and scientific interpretation
academic and educational use

SSTS is not:

a reaction model
a kinetic or rate law
a simulator or predictor
a learning or adaptive system
a decision-making authority
a governance or enforcement layer
a safety-certified or production control system

SSTS governs structural permission, not execution.
It does not enable, optimize, or trigger real-world transitions.

Any operational, commercial, or safety-critical use is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility and is not permitted under this license.
